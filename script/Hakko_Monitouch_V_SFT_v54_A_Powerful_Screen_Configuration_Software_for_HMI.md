In this article, we will introduce some of the main features and functions of Hakko Monitouch V SFT v5.4 in more detail. We will also provide some tips and tricks on how to use the software effectively and efficiently.
 
## Graphic Objects and Symbols
 
One of the most important aspects of screen design is the selection and placement of graphic objects and symbols. Hakko Monitouch V SFT v5.4 offers a wide range of graphic objects and symbols that you can use to create your screens. You can find them in the object palette, which is divided into several categories, such as basic shapes, buttons, switches, lamps, meters, graphs, charts and more. You can also import your own images or use the image library that contains over 5000 images.
 
To add a graphic object or symbol to your screen, you simply drag and drop it from the object palette to the screen editor. You can then resize, rotate, move, align, group or layer the object as you wish. You can also edit the properties of the object, such as color, font, text, value, expression, action and more. You can use the property window or the quick property window to access and change these properties easily.
 
Some graphic objects and symbols have special functions or features that make them more interactive and dynamic. For example, you can use the animation function to make an object change its appearance or position according to a condition or a value. You can also use the link function to make an object jump to another screen or open a pop-up window when clicked. You can also use the alarm function to make an object display an alarm message or sound when a certain event occurs. These functions can help you create more engaging and informative screens for your HMI devices.
 
## Macros and Scripts
 
Another important aspect of screen design is the control and logic of the HMI functions. Hakko Monitouch V SFT v5.4 allows you to create macros and scripts to define the behavior and operation of your HMI devices. Macros are sequences of commands that are executed when a certain trigger occurs, such as a button press, a timer event or a screen change. Scripts are programs that are written in a scripting language called V-Script, which is similar to Visual Basic. Scripts can perform more complex calculations and operations than macros.
 
To create a macro or a script, you can use the macro editor or the script editor that are integrated in Hakko Monitouch V SFT v5.4. You can also use the macro wizard or the script wizard to generate macros or scripts automatically based on your inputs. You can then assign macros or scripts to graphic objects or symbols using the action property. You can also create global macros or scripts that are executed at startup or shutdown of your HMI device.
 
Macros and scripts can help you control and manipulate various HMI functions and data sources, such as PLCs, databases, files, network devices and more. You can also use macros and scripts to create custom functions or expressions that are not available in Hakko Monitouch V SFT v5.4 by default. Macros and scripts can enhance the functionality and flexibility of your HMI devices.
